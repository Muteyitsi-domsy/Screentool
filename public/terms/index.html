      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last Updated: February 19, 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to ScreenFrame. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the ScreenFrame web application and related services (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

      <h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
      <p>ScreenFrame is a web-based screenshot formatting tool that allows users to upload screenshots and automatically frame, resize, and format them for professional presentation in app store listings. ScreenFrame utilizes a "local-first" architecture; all image processing and project storage occur locally within your browser's IndexedDB. We do not permanently store your screenshots on our servers unless you explicitly choose to enable optional cloud features.</p>

      <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
      <p>While the first screenshot slot is available without an account, accessing additional tray slots (up to 8) requires creating a ScreenFrame account and purchasing a license or subscription. Account authentication is handled by Supabase. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>

      <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in any way that violates these Terms. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to: uploading content that infringes on intellectual property rights, distributing malware, attempting to reverse engineer the Service, or interfering with the Service's integrity.</p>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>You retain full ownership of all images you upload to the Service. ScreenFrame does not claim any rights to your assets. ScreenFrame and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of ScreenFrame and its licensors.</p>

      <h2>6. Payment Terms</h2>
      <p>Payments are processed securely by <strong>Paddle</strong> as Merchant of Record. Paddle handles all billing, tax compliance, and payment processing. By making a purchase, you agree to Paddle's terms and conditions in addition to these Terms.</p>

      <h2>7. Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>All purchases are processed by <strong>Paddle</strong> as our Merchant of Record. Paddle's refund policy governs all transactions made through ScreenFrame.</p>
      <p><strong>One-Time Purchases (Lifetime License)</strong></p>
      <p>You may request a full refund within <strong>14 days</strong> of the original purchase date. No reason is required.</p>
      <p><strong>Subscriptions</strong></p>
      <p>You may request a full refund within <strong>14 days</strong> of the date on which your subscription was purchased or last renewed. No reason is required. You may cancel your subscription at any time through the Paddle billing portal; cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing cycle.</p>
      <p>To request a refund, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@screenframe.app">support@screenframe.app</a> or reach Paddle directly. Refunds are issued by Paddle in accordance with their <a href="https://www.paddle.com/legal/checkout-buyer-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buyer Terms</a>.</p>

      <h2>8. Subscription Terms &amp; Automatic Renewal</h2>
      <p>Subscriptions are billed on a recurring monthly or annual basis as selected during checkout. <strong>Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled before the renewal date.</strong> You can manage and cancel your subscriptions through the billing portal provided by Paddle.</p>

      <h2>9. Lifetime License</h2>
      <p>A "lifetime" license grants access to the Service for the lifetime of the product, not the lifetime of the purchaser. This means your license remains valid for as long as the ScreenFrame product continues to operate. We reserve the right to revoke access in cases of fraud, abuse, or violation of these Terms.</p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>

      <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. ScreenFrame makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the Service. ScreenFrame focuses on preparing screenshots that align with store guidelines; however, final approval always depends on each store's review process. We do not guarantee store acceptance.</p>

      <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>In no event shall ScreenFrame, its directors, employees, or partners be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

      <h2>13. Privacy</h2>
      <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please review our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for details on how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

      <h2>14. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

      <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Kenya, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
