      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last Updated: February 12, 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to ScreenFrame. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the ScreenFrame web application and related services (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

      <h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
      <p>ScreenFrame is a web-based screenshot formatting tool that allows users to upload screenshots and automatically frame, resize, and format them for professional presentation in app store listings. ScreenFrame utilizes a "local-first" architecture; all image processing and project storage occur locally within your browser's IndexedDB. We do not permanently store your screenshots on our servers unless you explicitly choose to enable optional cloud features.</p>

      <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
      <p>While basic features are available without an account, certain premium features (such as multiple tray slots or project syncing) may require the purchase of a license or subscription. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any license keys or account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>

      <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in any way that violates these Terms. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to: uploading content that infringes on intellectual property rights, distributing malware, attempting to reverse engineer the Service, or interfering with the Service's integrity.</p>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>You retain full ownership of all images you upload to the Service. ScreenFrame does not claim any rights to your assets. ScreenFrame and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of ScreenFrame and its licensors.</p>

      <h2>6. Payment Terms</h2>
      <p>All payments for ScreenFrame are processed by <strong>Paddle</strong> as our Merchant of Record. Paddle handles all customer service inquiries and returns related to payments. By making a purchase, you agree to Paddle's terms and conditions in addition to these Terms.</p>

      <h2>7. Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>We offer a 14-day refund policy for our digital goods. If you are unsatisfied with your purchase, you may request a refund within 14 days of the original transaction date, provided the license has not been excessively utilized. All refund requests are handled via Paddle.</p>

      <h2>8. Subscription Terms</h2>
      <p>Subscriptions are billed on a recurring monthly or annual basis as selected during checkout. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions through the billing portal provided by Paddle.</p>

      <h2>9. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>

      <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. ScreenFrame makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the Service. ScreenFrame focuses on preparing screenshots that align with store guidelines; however, final approval always depends on each store's review process. We do not guarantee store acceptance.</p>

      <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>In no event shall ScreenFrame, its directors, employees, or partners be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

      <h2>12. Privacy</h2>
      <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please review our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for details on how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

      <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

      <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
